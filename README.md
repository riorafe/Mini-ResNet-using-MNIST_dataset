# Mini-ResNet-using-MNIST_dataset

Before getting started, download the dataset from this link: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

I am using Google Collaboratory because GPU computing limitation from my PC, and with google collab I can have 12.72 Gigs of RAM hosted on GPU for free :) big thanks to collab!

I learned convolutional neural network theorem mainly from Stanford slides, and here is the link if you curious http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2019/

So, Why ResNet?
Along any other neural networks like AlexNet, VGG, GoogleNet, etc. Residual Net (ResNet) win 2015 ILSVRC with error rate 3.6% even slightly better than recognition capabilities of human that is 5.1%. I have looked at them, the principal of ResNet is fairly easy to be applied.

What's featured on my code:
1. Neat and clean code to improve readability of code for excellent collaboration
2. Use of earlystopping-based training and learning rate decay
3. Object Oriented Programming principle applied
